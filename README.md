### Project Description:

**Coffee Shop App**

The Coffee Shop App is an aesthetic and minimal mobile application crafted using Flutter, Hive, and the Provider state management library. This app is designed to offer coffee lovers a seamless experience, allowing them to browse and select their favorite coffee, manage their cart, and complete their purchases with ease.

### Key Features:
- **Add to Cart**: Users can explore a selection of coffee options and add their favorites to the cart effortlessly.
- **Delete from Cart**: Users can manage their selections by easily removing items from the cart.
- **Pay Now**: The "Pay Now" feature enables users to complete their purchases securely and efficiently.
- **Persistent Cart Data**: Leveraging Hive for local storage, the app ensures that the user's cart data is saved, so even if the app is closed, the cart contents remain intact upon reopening.

The minimalist design of the app ensures a clean and focused user interface, prioritizing functionality and user experience. Flutter's cross-platform capabilities combined with Hive's efficient local storage and Provider's state management result in a responsive, fast, and reliable application.
